# Hi! I'm Maks
I like coding, currently I'm studying Cybersecurity @ AGH

```c
/* I have a lot ideas of what could I make but my life is currently like this */
while(1) {
  wakeup();
  goto university;

  university:
  attend_lessons();
  goto home;

  home:
  think_about_what_could_i_code();
  realize_that_university_have_alredy_given_me_math_todo();
  do_math(); // :(
  sleep();
}
```
